    " In this lesson, you will see how to use reinforcement learning by training your model using penalties. Below is a grid for a self-driving taxi cab that has 4 points to drop off and pick up a passenger.  In the real world, you would also have pedestrians and obstacles, that the Taxi would need to be aware of. Let's venture out and see what our Taxi can do!\n",
