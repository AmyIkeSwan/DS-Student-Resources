### Required Resources: 
- Ground-based students are required to bring a laptop computer (either PC or MacBook) to class every day.  

- Online students are required to have a laptop or desktop computer with internet access.  

- Minimum: PC (Windows) or MacBook laptop. 8GB ram, 512GB HD, Core i5 / AMD Rizen or  M1 Chipsets

- Recommended: PC (Windows) or MacBook laptop. 16GB ram, 1TB SSD, Core i7 AMD Rizen or New M1 Pro/Max Chipsets

- It is requirement that you are able to download programming resources to your laptop/desktop for this class. This means you need a steady-state internet high-bandwidth connection.

- Quiet place to study and focus on the material and have uninterrupted video meetings.
