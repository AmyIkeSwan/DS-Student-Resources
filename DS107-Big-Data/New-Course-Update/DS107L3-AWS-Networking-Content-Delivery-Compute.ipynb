An IP address is similar to a phone number and must be unique on that subnet for it to adequately communicate with other computers have their own IP address. Machines convert that decimal number to a binary format in order to use it. For the IP address 192.0.2.0, each of the four dot separated numbers of the address represent a maximum of 8 bits called an octet. This means that each of the four numbers can be anything from 0 to 255. The combined total of the four numbers for an IP address is 32 bits in binary format.

A CIDR address is expressed as an IP address, which is the first address of the network followed by a / (forward slash character). Where the prefix must be steady and not changeable and allocated for the network identifier. The bits that are not fixed are allowed to change. CIDR is a way to express a group of IP addresses that are consecutive to each other. In the above example, the CIDR address is 192.0.2.0/24 where the last octet is changeable and the first three octets are fixed. This means that there are 256 addresses available for this network.
