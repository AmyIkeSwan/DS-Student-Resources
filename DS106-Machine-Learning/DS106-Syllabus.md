### Required Resources: 
- Ground-based students are required to bring a laptop computer (either PC or MacBook) to class every day.  

- Online students are required to have a laptop or desktop computer with internet access.  

- Minimum: PC (Windows) or Mac laptop. 8GB ram, 512GB HD, Intel Core i5,  AMD Ryzen 5, or Apple Intel or M1 Chipsets.

- Recommended: PC (Windows) or Mac laptop. 16GB ram, 1TB SSD, Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen 7, or Apple M1/M1 Pro Chipsets.

- Professionals: PC (Windows) or Mac. 32-64 GB ram, 2-8TB SSD, Intel Core i9, AMD Ryzen 9/Threadripper, or Apple M1 Max Chipsets.

- It is requirement that you are able to download programming resources to your laptop/desktop for this class. This means you need a steady-state internet high-bandwidth connection.

- You are required to have a quiet place to study and be able to focus on the material.

- You are required to have uninterrupted weekly 1:1 video meetings with your mentor.

- You are required to log into the Learning Management System (LMS) daily for at least 20 minutes.

### Final Project:
Using Python, create a decision tree model of the Titanic dataset from seaborn.  Interpret the confusion matrix and classification report.  

Required to run two different simulations, a Monte Carlo to predict profit of a certain tool, and an expensive piece of equipment that needs to limit inventory.  Create a table with the information requested.
