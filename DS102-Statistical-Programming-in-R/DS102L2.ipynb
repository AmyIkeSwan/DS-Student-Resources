    "\n",
    "R has many strengths. Because it is a programming language, it is very flexible and can be extended to do many different types of statistical analysis. There is a large and vibrant user community that is applying R to many different types of analysis and application areas. This user community is also extending the capabilities of R through “packages” that implement specialized statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "R includes a core set of packages in its distribution; more than 10,000 additional packages are available through the internet. You will use several different packages in this course. In the last several years, R has been used extensively for data science, not just statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How R Differs from Other Programs and Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Because R is a programming language, and not just a stats software program, its use is quite different than many statistical analysis packages such as Minitab or SAS. In many stats software programs, there is a point and click element:  you load a data set, then use a menu command to instruct the package to perform an analysis of the data set. The package will produce copious amounts of output and graphs from this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "R includes some of these features, but relies much more heavily on coding.  R is designed so that the statistical analysis is normally performed by going through a series of steps, each of which requires a bit of R code; intermediate results from each step are stored in objects. Once the desired object is complete, you will get information and graphics by manipulating the object, again using bits of R code.\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a language that is designed to be good at statistical analysis. While theoretically, you could use it for other tasks, it would be impractical, because other programming languages are better adapted for general software engineering purposes.  \n",

    "# R Script Files \n",
    "As you progress through this module and things become more complex, typing R commands into the Console pane may become cumbersome, especially if you type slowly or inaccurately. There are several things you can do to make this less tiring. One is to create R script files and use RStudio's features to execute these files (or parts of these files). \n",
    "\n",
    "R provides a way to store a sequence of statements in a file so they can be executed together without typing them into the Console window. A sequence of statements stored in a file is called a script (also a program). R executes each statement in a script in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "R scripts are text files and can be edited in any text editor. However, it is much easier to create and edit R scripts in an editor that is designed for this purpose. Fortunately, RStudio has a built-in source editor to create and edit files of R code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The editor has several productivity-enhancing features: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax highlighting.  Different parts will turn color depending on what part of the program it is. \n",
    "* Code completion, which automatically inserts certain characters.\n",
    "* Find/replace\n",
    "\n",
    "You will introduce the process of creating and running a script by building on your first experience as an R programmer. Suppose you want to say \"Hello World!\" in three different languages. You could do this with the following command typed into the console:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "print(\"Hallo Welt!\")\n",
    "print(\"Hola mundo!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it and see the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you wish to greet the world in these three languages every morning. You could type the command above every morning, but this would become tiresome. Instead, you can create a script with these commands and then ask R to run the script every morning to greet the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RStudio, you can start the editor and create a new R program file by using the ```File -> New File``` menu and selecting ```R Script```.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An R Studio window showing dropdown menus along the top of the window. The dropdown file is selected and shows the options new file, new project, open file, recent files, open project, open project in new session, recent projects, import dataset, and quit session. New file is selected and shows the options R script, R notebook, R markdown, shiny web app, text file, c plus plus file, R sweave, R h t m l, R presentation, and R documentation. R script is selected.](Media/L03-NewFile.png)\n",

Line three, print open parentheses quote hola mundo exclamation mark end quote close parentheses.](Media/L03-EditorPane.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each print statement is on its own line. This is generally done when programming, since it makes the code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, after having created a script, you will want save it as a file; if you don't save it, it goes away when you quit RStudio. You can do this with the ```File -> Save``` menu, or click the floppy disk icon at the top of the script. Once you have saved your script, you can have R execute it by using the ```Code -> Source``` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do this, R runs the code in your file and prints the output it generates. (Note that you can also execute your code by clicking on the Source drop-down menu in the editor pane).\n",
    "\n",
    "![An editor pane in an R studio window with three print commands. Above each command is a comment, hash tag this is to demonstrate scripts.

Line three, print open parentheses quote hola mundo exclamation mark end quote close parentheses.](Media/R3.png)\n",

    "[1] \"Hallo Welt!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] \"Hola mundo!\"\n",

    "Note that R executed the first statement first and printed \"Hello World!\" It then went to the next statement, executed it, and printed \"Hallo Welt!\" Finally, it executed the last statement and printed \"Hola mundo!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements in scripts are executed sequentially except when ```if``` and ```for``` statements alter this (as you will learn later).\n",
    "\n",

    "# Finding Documentation and Help\n",

    "There may be times that you will need to check R's documentation to see how to do a particular analysis. You can access some documentation in RStudio using the ```Help -> R Help``` menu. This brings up a page of useful links in the Help pane of RStudio. You can also access the official R Manuals online **[here.](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)**\n",

    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to start building up your problem solving skills as soon as possible! The earlier you try to troubleshoot your own issues, the better off you will be, because as a data scientist, you will be expected to solve problems daily and search for solutions! For a primer on how to search the internet for solutions, check out **[this recorded live workshop on How to Google Like a Pro.](https://vimeo.com/416182456)** Even if you are not successful in solving your own issues all the time, giving it a shot will help you build up those critical thinking muscles! Every little bit helps!\n",

    "\n",
    "This lesson was your first introduction to R, a program specifically designed for data science and statistical programming! You learned how to use the ```print()``` and ```help()``` functions, and got familiar with the layout of R, including the console and the script files.  You also learned about the importance of commenting your code, for the utility of yourself and others later on.  \n",
