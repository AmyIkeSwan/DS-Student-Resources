    "For your Lesson 2 Hands-On, you will be practicing your new skills with operators, string concatenation, and control flow. For this project, you will be creating a new directory, so please follow the below setup instructions. This Hands-On **will** be graded, so be sure you complete all requirements.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, open up your command prompt/terminal\n",
    "2. Within your command prompt/terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ``` \n",
    "3. Next, run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Run the following to create a new directory for this project:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_two_handson\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode. \n",
    "6. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "7. Click the `Open Folder` button.   \n",
    "8. Select the `lesson_two_handson` directory within the `python_course` folder on your Desktop. Click the `Open` button. \n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_TWO_HANDSON__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",

    "3. Assign the concatenation to a fourth variable named `my_birthday`. \n",
    "4. Finally, `print` the variable `my_birthday` to see if you have the format identical to the one in the example below:\n",
    "    - For example, if your birthday is on November 11th of 1991, then the format/output should be `November 11, 1991`\n",
